write a blog on differnece between http 1.1 vs http 2

Http 1.1

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user
HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997
it compresses data by itself
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive.
it was request resorce inlining for use getting multile pages 
It works on the textual format.
The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form


Http/ 2

new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015
HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol
HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
it works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.
HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header  it compresses the header. 
The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
